## Theme: Object instantiation via constructors

**Task1**
Consist of a class Box. The Box object have three instance variables of floating number type(double): height, width, depth;
It is possible to instantiate box object in 3 ways:

- without parameters (every attribute is instantiated to 1)
- With 1 parameter (every attribute is instantiated with that parameter)
- With 3 parameters for each attribute.

The box have 2 methods for calculation of its surface area and volume.

**Task2**

Consist of a class Queue. Each queue have as state the number of elements from it and can be created via constructors of 2 types - with parameter and without it.
This class have add and get methods for adding elements to the queue and extraction of them.

Also are implemented two methods which should determine if the queue is empty or full. (isEmpty(), isFull()).
