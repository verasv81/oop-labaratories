In this folder you can find a program which verify if a mathematical expression is correct from the point of view of the parentheses within it.

Ex: (29 + 4) - (3(2+76) + 55) - correct 

Ex: ((( 2-4 * 9 + 3 * (4 + 5) - incorrect (3 unclosed parentheses)

The expression is read from the file attached at this laboratory(expression.txt ) and print the result if the parentheses are put correct in this expression.
